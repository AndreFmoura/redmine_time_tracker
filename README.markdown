# Redmine Time Tracker plugin rewrite (work title: Chronos)

This is a complete rewrite of the timetracker plugin. This code base is heavily work in progress and is expected to change steadily.
With this said, while you can install the plugin for now, it's not usable though. Still working on the data structure ;)

We will keep this readme up to date with further progress. In case you have any questions or annotations to this rewrite please comment in issue [#194](https://github.com/hicknhack-software/redmine_time_tracker/issues/194).

## Requirements
* Redmine 2.6.0
* ruby >= 2.0.0
